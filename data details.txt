Context
The gender pay gap or gender wage gap is the average difference between the remuneration for men and women who are working. Women are generally considered to be paid less than men. There are two distinct numbers regarding the pay gap: non-adjusted versus adjusted pay gap. The latter typically takes into account differences in hours worked, occupations were chosen, education, and job experience. In the United States, for example, the non-adjusted average female's annual salary is 79% of the average male salary, compared to 95% for the adjusted average salary.

The reasons link to legal, social, and economic factors, and extend beyond "equal pay for equal work".

The gender pay gap can be a problem from a public policy perspective because it reduces economic output and means that women are more likely to be dependent upon welfare payments, especially in old age.

This dataset aims to replicate the data used in the famous paper "The Gender Wage Gap: Extent, Trends, and Explanations", which provides new empirical evidence on the extent of and trends in the gender wage gap, which declined considerably during the 1980–2010 period.

Content
There are 2 files in this dataset: a) the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) microdata over the 1980-2010 period, and b) the Current Population Survey (CPS) to provide some additional US national data on the gender pay gap.

PSID variables:

NOTES: THE VARIABLES WITH fz ADDED TO THEIR NAME REFER TO EXPERIENCE WHERE WE HAVE FILLED IN SOME ZEROS IN THE MISSING PSID YEARS WITH DATA FROM THE RESPONDENTS’ ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ABOUT JOBS WORKED ON DURING THESE MISSING YEARS. THE fz variables WERE USED IN THE REGRESSION ANALYSES
THE VARIABLES WITH A predict PREFIX REFER TO THE COMPUTATION OF ACTUAL EXPERIENCE ACCUMULATED DURING THE YEARS IN WHICH THE PSID DID NOT SURVEY THE RESPONDENTS. THERE ARE MORE PREDICTED EXPERIENCE LEVELS THAT ARE NEEDED TO IMPUTE EXPERIENCE IN THE MISSING YEARS IN SOME CASES.
NOTE THAT THE VARIABLES yrsexpf, yrsexpfsz, etc., INCLUDE THESE COMPUTATIONS, SO THAT IF YOU WANT TO USE FULL TIME OR PART TIME EXPERIENCE, YOU DON’T NEED TO ADD THESE PREDICT VARIABLES IN. THEY ARE INCLUDED IN THE DATA SET TO ILLUSTRATE THE RESULTS OF THE COMPUTATION PROCESS.
THE VARIABLES WITH AN orig PREFIX ARE THE ORIGINAL PSID VARIABLES. THESE HAVE BEEN PROCESSED AND IN SOME CASES RENAMED FOR CONVENIENCE. THE hd SUFFIX MEANS THAT THE VARIABLE REFERS TO THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY, AND THE wf SUFFIX MEANS THAT IT REFERS TO THE WIFE OR FEMALE COHABITOR IF THERE IS ONE. AS SHOWN IN THE ACCOMPANYING REGRESSION PROGRAM, THESE orig VARIABLES AREN’T USED DIRECTLY IN THE REGRESSIONS. THERE ARE MORE OF THE ORIGINAL PSID VARIABLES, WHICH WERE USED TO CONSTRUCT THE VARIABLES USED IN THE REGRESSIONS. HD MEANS HEAD AND WF MEANS WIFE OR FEMALE COHABITOR.
